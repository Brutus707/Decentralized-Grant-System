## Vision

The Decentralized Grant System aims to revolutionize the way grants for educational research are distributed by leveraging blockchain technology. Our mission is to create a transparent, efficient, and tamper-proof system for allocating funds through smart contracts, ensuring that educational institutions and researchers receive financial support in a fair and decentralized manner. By eliminating intermediaries and reducing administrative overhead, we envision a more equitable distribution of resources that fosters innovation and educational advancement.

## Smart Contract Address

- **Network**: `Ethereum/Polygon/BSC, etc.`
- **Contract Address**: `0x188aF6A44C2561bBA1996555deD995Bcf2C603D4`
  - This is the Ethereum address of the deployed smart contract responsible for managing grant proposals, approvals, and fund distributions.

## Future Scope

1. **Multi-Chain Support**: Expand compatibility to include multiple blockchain networks for broader reach and flexibility.
2. **Enhanced Features**: Integrate features like reputation systems for proposal reviewers and automated milestone tracking.
3. **User Interface**: Develop a user-friendly front-end application to streamline interactions with the system and provide comprehensive reporting tools.
4. **Governance Mechanisms**: Implement decentralized governance models to allow stakeholders to participate in decision-making processes related to grant management.
5. **Global Expansion**: Adapt the system to support grants in various languages and currencies to facilitate global access.
